Authors associate many things with the moment when current persons can no longer be held criminally liable for artificial intelligence. For example, John Danaher argues that humans are naturally retributive beings, and when harm is done to them, they seek someone who deserves punishment. He also argues that with increasing robotization, the number of cases where robots cause damage or harm will also increase. In combination, according to him, a so-called retributive gap may emerge.

Various authors then try to address the retributive gap in different ways. One concept that could fill it — though we don't yet know how — and also the concept that has generated the most controversy in recent years, is the concept of criminal liability of artificial intelligence itself, which Gabriel Hallevy once proposed.

This raises the question of whether we should even attempt to transfer contemporary criminal law concepts, such as culpability, to the concept of criminal liability of artificial intelligence. Personally, I feel that through often absurd applications of human concepts and human attributes to artificial intelligence, we are absurdly trying to close doors to a still-undefined third model.
