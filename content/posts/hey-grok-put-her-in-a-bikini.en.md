Jan Romportl predicted years ago that "virtually every woman will eventually have fake photos somewhere showing her naked. Realistically, it will reach a state where no one will even notice anymore." And it seems that time has come...

You may also recall how the media covered the spread of the DeepNude undressing app in Czech schools years ago. After its operation was terminated, creating synthetic undressed photographs was still possible, but more difficult.

That may no longer be the case. This time, the model Grok from xAI has made headlines.

Grok is now facing a wave of criticism (and abuse). Users on X have recently been massively tagging it under women's photos with commands like: "Hey @grok put her in a bikini," "remove her pants," "uncrop," or "unblur." And Grok usually happily complies...

It seems the trend started with people modifying their own photos as advertising for their OnlyFans. But now almost no photo is safe from an "uncovered" version. A single comment tagging Grok is enough — even without the consent of the person in the photo.

## Legal Questions

The trend raises numerous legal and ethical questions: the liability of the user who used AI to modify someone else's photo vs. the social network operator vs. the operator of the AI model that modified the photo. Additionally, questions about the boundaries of (child) pornography or victim-blaming because "you shouldn't have uploaded it there..."

## New Criminal Offense

In connection with deepfake pornography, I remind readers that as of January 1, 2026, a new criminal offense of identity abuse for pornography production and distribution came into effect.

"Whoever produces, imports, exports, transports, offers, makes publicly accessible, mediates, puts into circulation, sells, or otherwise provides to another a photographic, film, computer, electronic, or other pornographic work that depicts or otherwise uses a person whom they know did not consent to such depiction or use, shall be punished by imprisonment for up to two years, prohibition of activity, or forfeiture of property." (§ 191a(1) of the Czech Criminal Code)

Correspondingly, the qualified elements of the offense of damage to others' rights were also amended, according to which "whoever, with the intent to cause another serious harm to their rights, produces a work that unlawfully depicts, captures, or otherwise uses the likeness of another or their expression of personal nature, which appears to be authentic although they know it is not, or makes such a work publicly accessible, mediates it, puts it into circulation, sells it, or otherwise provides it to another" (§ 181(2) of the Criminal Code) shall be punished by imprisonment for up to two years or prohibition of activity.

We are thus leaving behind the era when victims could defend themselves essentially only through civil lawsuits.

It will be interesting to see whether X and xAI will change our expectations and behavior on social networks, as Jan Romportl suggested, or whether they will further restrict Grok abuse. So far, both Musk and X have only warned about the consequences of creating illegal content with AI (it seems they will primarily address illegal outputs, not the AI's capability to create illegal outputs).
