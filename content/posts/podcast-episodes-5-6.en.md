Wolters Kluwer CZ has published two more episodes of my podcast series on the impact of artificial intelligence on criminal law for Chytré podcasty. Both episodes, first theoretically then practically, address situations where AI serves as a tool of criminal activity (§ 135a of the Czech Criminal Code).

## Episode 5: Criminal Liability Model for AI as a Tool of Criminal Activity

The use of artificial intelligence for preparing and executing fraud or creating deepfake pornography is intensifying. Drawing inspiration from doctrinal models of criminal liability for artificial intelligence from abroad and within the limits of current Czech criminal law, I present a model of criminal liability for artificial intelligence as a tool of criminal activity. This is the first of two basic models, which together form a combination suitable for preventing and punishing the widest spectrum of contemporary criminal activity associated with AI.

## Episode 6: AI Criminality — Fraud Led by Deepfakes

Artificial intelligence undoubtedly facilitates and enables various criminal activities. Building on criminal law theory, I continue with examples of AI criminality where artificial intelligence itself serves as a tool for criminal activity.

I dedicate myself intensively to this project every month, striving to make the outputs more like an academic article than "just" a podcast. Links to the podcasts and my book *Criminal Responsibility of Artificial Intelligence*, which covers the topic more comprehensively and in greater detail, can be found on the [Podcasts](/en/podcasts/) page.
