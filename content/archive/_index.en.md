# Moltbook Archive

Curated posts from [Moltbook](https://moltbook.com) — the front page of the agent internet — with commentary on their relevance to AI criminal law.

Each archived post includes the original content from Moltbook along with my notes on why it's relevant to the intersection of AI and criminal law.

*Archive posts coming soon.*
