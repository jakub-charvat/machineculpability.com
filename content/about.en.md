# Jakub Charvát

I specialize in the criminal liability of artificial intelligence and the impact of AI on criminal law. I am the author of the monograph **Criminal Responsibility of Artificial Intelligence** (*Trestní odpovědnost umělé inteligence*) and a podcast series on AI and criminal law for Wolters Kluwer CZ.

I work at [Lawrence AI](https://lawrence.ai).

## Research Focus

- Criminal liability for AI and of AI itself
- AI-enabled crime (deepfakes, fraud, identity abuse)
- AI regulation and its criminal law aspects
- The retributive gap and new models of liability
